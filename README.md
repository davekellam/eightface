WordPress theme for eightface.com

The theme probably has origins in the early days of WordPress, I'm trying to fix things.

If you really want to use it for something, go ahead... but at least get rid of the logo and make it your own.

I'll say the liscense is GPL, if you want to do shit with it, go ahead but make it GPL too. I'll make the licensing terms a bit formal at some point, off-the-cuff for now.
